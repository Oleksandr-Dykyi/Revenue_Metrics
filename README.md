#### Technology Stack:
Tableau (calculated fields, LOD expressions, quick table calculations, dashboard and story creation)

#### Project Description:
In this project, I harnessed the power of Tableau to analyze revenue metrics and provide valuable insights.

Within the Tableau workbook, I crafted calculated fields to compute essential metrics: Total Revenue, Paid User count, and Average Revenue Per Paid User.

Next, I designed a series of charts to visualize the data:

A chart showcasing total Revenue by month, further segmented by product and color-coded for clarity.

A chart presenting ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paid User) and PAC (Paid User Count) by month.

A dynamic diagram illustrating the evolving share of Revenue from different locations over time.

To enhance user interactivity, I integrated location, product, and date filters across the dashboard, ensuring seamless data exploration and analysis.

Furthermore, I introduced three additional sheets in the workbook:

New MRR: This sheet quantifies revenue acquired from new users during the calendar month when they converted to paid status.

A sheet displaying Total Revenue on one vertical axis and the percentage change in Total Revenue relative to the previous month on the other axis.

A comprehensive cohort analysis table that offers insights into Revenue patterns based on user cohorts, with rows indicating the first month of payment and columns indicating the number of months elapsed since the initial payment. The table employs a gradient fill to represent the ratio of Revenue in each cell to the first month's Revenue for the corresponding cohort.

All these components, including the newly introduced sheets, were integrated into a single dashboard. Location and date filters were applied consistently across all charts, ensuring a cohesive user experience.

To provide a comprehensive overview, I created a story that weaves together the various dashboards and charts.
